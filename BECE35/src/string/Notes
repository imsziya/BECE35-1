* String value is group of chars written within double quotes

* In java String is a class which is used to store group of
  chars the String object.
  
* String class is immediate sub-class of Object class

* String class implements Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence interfaces

* String class is final and it cannot be inherited.

* hashCode() of Object class is overriden in String class
  which returns an integer value that is generated based on
  unicode values of every character present in given String
  
* toString() of Object class is overriden in String class
  which returns the string value present in given string
  object.
  
* equals() of Object class is overriden in String class
  which compares characters present in given 2 strings
  and returns true if they are same else returns false
  
* String objects are created in special memory area called string pool in heap areaa
  
* The String pool consist of two parts 
  1.Constant pool
  2.Non-constant pool
  
* String objects can be created in 2 diff ways
  1. By using new operator
  2. Without using new operator
  
* If you create a String object without using new operator then the object will be
  created in Constant pool.
  
* If you create a String object by using new operator then the object will be 
  created in non-constant pool.
  
 Note : == operator compares address of given two Objects.
 
 * Within constant pool duplicates are not allowed.
 
 * Within non-constant pool duplicates are allowed. 
 
 * If you create any string object in following format then the resultant string object
   will be created in non-constant pool.
